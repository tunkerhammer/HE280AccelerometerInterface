# HE280AccelerometerInterface

this is a fork from Trash80 HE280AccelerometerInterface which is a simple Arduino program for interfacing a Teensy 3/3.2 to Seemecnc's HE280 hotend probe for use with a Duet controller or other 3D printer controllers that do not have i2c probing options.

The program was changed to work with a Adafruit basic feather and to work with duetwifi firmware 1.17b

Pin configuration is commented in the main source file.
